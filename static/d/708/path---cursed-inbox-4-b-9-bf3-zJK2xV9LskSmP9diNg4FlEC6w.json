My job brings with it the privilege of the rabid dog chase every other month or so. Become a spy, they said. You’ll get cool guns and stuff, they said. Well, I’m getting something else as well: pissed off.</p>\n<p>As I step off the monorail and make my way up the city junction, I take a moment to appreciate the billboard-dense sky of the most retro metropolis to exist after the Great Space War. Loud red and blue neon lights flashed everywhere, a digital rain that bounced from one skyline to another. It’s the year 2071, and everything has changed. AI, the existence of aliens, the whole nine yards. No one has bent space and time yet, so that’s cool. At least my trenchcoat is still in vogue. I stride along the herd of other dark entities, hidden in the shadows cast by kilometers of bright lighting strips that lit the city up. Downtown is packed and sweaty, and some deep techno music is playing somewhere out there, nicely muffled by the silent humming of the city’s dank underbelly. I feel weary, and my legs feel like they’re made of lead. I stumble, and right before my vision blurs, a dingy convenience store looms up in my vision.

I haven’t showered for roughly the same amount of time. <i>Dave…</i></p>\n<p>As the cold, suspiciously slimy water washes over my face, I run over the events that had take place in the past 48 hours. Dave had gone missing very randomly, and although he was a prick, he wasn’t irresponsible.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Charlie Letterman's Cursed Inbox","date":"April 08, 2020","description":null}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/cursed-inbox/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/lost-in-translation/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Lost in Translation - An affair with the feels"}},"next":null}}
