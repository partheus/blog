As the title suggests, I have an 8-hour layover here. And then an 8-hour flight. And then an 8-hour sleep regime in my own bed.</p>\n<p>One of the best things about international airports is that you can observe and document as much as you want for character inspiration. Not to say that the British gentleman staring back at me might not have been James Bond.</p>\n<p>Today, I return home after almost a year. This, while not much of a deal to the casual observer, is kind of a big deal.</p>\n<p>There is a lot to be said about studying/working in the United States.
