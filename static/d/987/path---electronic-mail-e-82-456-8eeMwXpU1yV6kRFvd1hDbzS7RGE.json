My job brings with it the privilege of the rabid dog chase every other month or so. Become a spy, they said. You’ll get cool guns and stuff, they said. Well, I’m getting something else as well: pissed off.</p>\n<p>As I step off the monorail and make my way up the city junction, I take a moment to appreciate the billboard-dense sky of the most retro metropolis to exist after the Great Space War. Loud red and blue neon lights flashed everywhere, a digital rain that bounced from one skyline to another. It’s the year 2071, and everything has changed. AI, the existence of aliens, the whole nine yards. No one has bent space and time yet, so that’s cool. At least my trenchcoat is still in vogue. I stride along the herd of other dark entities, hidden in the shadows cast by kilometers of bright lighting strips that lit the city up. Downtown is packed and sweaty, and some deep techno music is playing somewhere out there, nicely muffled by the silent humming of the city’s dank underbelly. I feel weary, and my legs feel like they’re made of lead. I stumble, and right before my vision blurs, a dingy convenience store looms up in my vision. Tightening my trenchcoat and making sure my gun’s still in the holster, I trudge through the last couple of meters and push my way into the public restroom. “Ah, <i>fuck</i>…” I say, to the extremely crusty-looking man in the mirror.</p>\n<p>My handler has been missing for a couple days. I haven’t showered for roughly the same amount of time. <i>Dave…</i></p>\n<p>As the cold, suspiciously slimy water washes over my face, I run over the events that had take place in the past 48 hours. Dave had gone missing very randomly, and although he was a prick, he wasn’t irresponsible. The middle-aged man had been my mentor for several months after I was approved for field service. It began to rain outside, more or less at the same time that my phone rang. I jumped, startled from the sudden vibration next to my hip. <i>Why am I so jittery?</i></p>\n<p>“Letterman?” a raspy voice hissed at me through the phone. “Charlie, is that you?”</p>\n<p>“Holy shit, Dave?” I stumbled toward the exit. “Where are yo-”</p>\n<p>“Listen, Charlie, you stupid idiot. Don’t believe them, yeah? It’s not what you think. Get to safety asap. Don’t worry about m-” <i>Thwack!</i> A very wet-sounding thud echoed in the background, and he hung up. My real name is not Charlie Letterman. I may be a loser, but not the CEO of losers. I always wondered what Dave’s real name was; he always seemed to me like a real Dave. My phone screen lit up for a moment, and the LED blinked orange a couple times. I had an unread email. Who the fuck’s send me emails right now? I click it open.</p>\n<p><b>24447398</b></p>\n<p>That’s all the body of the email says. Before I can take a look at the details, however, the door of the restroom is thrown open and a woman dressed in full black camouflage enters, knee first. I am a very averagely built man. My face was declared the fifth most-forgettable face in college. But I am a agile. As the woman’s knee swooshes toward my abdomen, I shove an elbow into her thigh, even as my phone makes its way into one of the folds of my trench coat. Nifty piece of apparel, let me tell ya.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Electronic mail","date":"April 08, 2020","description":null}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/electronic-mail/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/lost-in-translation/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Lost in Translation - An affair with the feels"}},"next":null}}
