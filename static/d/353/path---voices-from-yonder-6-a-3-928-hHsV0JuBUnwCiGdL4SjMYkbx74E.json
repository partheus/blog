Not being able to play with a toy for less than a day held a far deeper significance for nine-year-old Emma than her parents could fathom.</p>\n<p>It was a Saturday. Emma sat in the verandah of the countryside cottage. Her father tended to the fireplace while her mother talked his ear off about finding her brother a job. The house smelled of honeysuckle and freshly-baked bread. For all intents and purposes, this was a day straight out of a dream. Emma did not think so. Wiping a tear with the back of her hand, she stood up and dusted her clothes off. “Mama!” she called out. “I’m going down to the lake! I’ll be back in time for dinner!”</p>\n<p>“Emma, wait!” her mother huffed. “This girl!”</p>\n<p>Emma’s father smiled and poked the fire a bit more. “She’ll be fine,” he said, and reached out for his wife.</p>\n<p>In the moonlight, Emma ran. Her feet padded along the grass, kicking up small clouds of dew as she bounded across the countryside. It was lush, like a spell had been cast everywhere, infusing every little bit of nature with life. </p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Voices from yonder","date":"April 11, 2020","description":"20 minute speedrun"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/voices-from-yonder/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/no-shoot-messenger/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Don't shoot the messenger"}},"next":null}}
