Jean Deaux, a French exchange student majoring in Street Epistemology, attested to other rumors. “It’s true, yep,” they said. “I could see everything from my apartment above Welch, clear as a sunny day in November. Students entered the Kum &amp;#x26; Go in large hordes – showing at least seven symptoms of the virus – but exited with beaming smiles on their faces. They were shouting something about Saturdays and buoys, haha,” said Deaux. “Physics was never my strongest suit.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Governor Kim Reynolds decided that it was a-ok to open up select (77) counties in Iowa, there was a silent uproar from the very upper echelons of partygoing professionals. “We can’t thank her enough!” said one student, explicitly stating that she wished to be named. “I’ve missed my friends so much omg [sic]!” It is no wonder that cause and effect are so closely related. The signed order from Gov. Reynolds allows restaurants, fitness centers, malls, libraries, race tracks and other such establishments to open back up, with some restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What this has done is that it has effectively redirected some of the traffic from neighboring counties (which remain closed) into counties that will be opening up, like Story county. Students from neighboring sub-par universities have started pouring in. From a very heated thread on Reddit, it appears that Central Campus was teeming with inebriated students, uncharacteristically happy for a Friday evening of finals week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s not the same,” said the student who stated that she wished to be named. “Bars are just as essential, not fair!” I managed to get a word with the manager of the Kum &amp;#x26; Go as well. “No.” When I tried to contact other students who seemed to be recovering from the virus from just six shots of tequila, I was surprised to see that they were not only recovering, they were doing six additional shots just to take care of the virus once and for all. One graduate student in full cowboy garb kept shotgunning beers and whispering “If you know, you know.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It appears that this new technique of combating the virus is being met with mixed reactions; as is the case with any well-meaning attempt at saving the world. “I cannot believe people are hating on us [sic],” said another student, who wished to be referred to as just Ice. “Bonfires and Mike’s Hards on the Quad with 32 other people? Are you kidding me? Easiest cure ever.” To my astonishment, Just Ice then went on to elaborately describe the process of how the investigational nucleotide restructures the pathogen to render it benign. “Pfft, remdesivir-shremdesivir, all in a day’s work,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The party hypothesis seems to be spreading like a wild virus – in a manner surprisingly akin to a pandemic – across the country. Even esteemed virologist Dr. Anthony Fauci was seen screaming “Do it for State!” on his private Snapchat story before going AWOL. Hopefully, the coming weeks will show similar results and bring in further insights. In the meantime, wash your gloves and stay hydrated!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt; DISCLAIMER: SATIRE &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Voices from yonder]]></title><description><![CDATA[Ever since her little doll had gone missing, Emma Whelker had become increasingly and increasingly morose.

Not being able to play with a toy for less than a day held a far deeper significance for twelve-year-old Emma than her parents could fathom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a Saturday. Emma sat in the verandah of the countryside cottage. Her father tended to the fireplace while her mother talked his ear off about finding her brother a job. The house smelled of honeysuckle and freshly-baked bread. For all intents and purposes, this was a day straight out of a dream. Emma did not think so. Wiping a tear with the back of her hand, she stood up and dusted her clothes off. “Mama!” she called out. “I’m going down to the lake! I’ll be back in time for dinner!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Emma, wait!” her mother huffed. “This girl!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emma’s father smiled and poked the fire a bit more. “She’ll be fine,” he said, and reached out for his wife.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the moonlight, Emma ran. Her feet padded along the grass, kicking up small clouds of dew as she bounded across the countryside. It was lush, like a spell had been cast everywhere, infusing every little bit of nature with life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lake was wider than anything Emma had seen, and it reminded her of a calmer place, and so it became her safe space. She came down here to tell the lake about her life. There were frequent monologues at the lake about the boys at school, about the teacher who reminded her of uncle Jakob, about the weird way her nose was shaped, about all the things that made Emma happy, and sad, and sometimes both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, Emma cried about her doll. “Oh, Zelda!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lake rippled softly in a gentle breeze, a wind that caressed Emma’s face, as though to let her know that yes, we feel your sorrow. Zelda, the toy that Emma had bought from the flea market. Zelda, an even bigger confidante of the shy girl everyone bullied at school. Zelda, who had been missing from the house for the whole day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Oh, Zelda” wailed Emma, running her fingers along the waterline. “I miss you. Jared looked at me today.” Emma grinned. “It was fun! Come back, Zelda.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The water gurgled. Emma thought about Zelda’s weird and misshapen face. It gave her confidence. Why, she, Emma, was so much prettier than this ugly doll? Why would I care about the bullies?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emma thought about Zelda’s twisted torso, bound together by rags of a child who could perhaps only dream of affording to go to school. Flea markets were fun places, Emma thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The water rippled, a little more roughly than a moment before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emma thought about the times she had punched the doll in abject bouts of anger, in misguided acts of boredom. She felt the absence of the doll’s company, but not as a companion, no. As an object of catharsis, maybe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lake suddenly parted, and a dark, wet object floated to the top, barely a stone’s throw from Emma. She looked up, shocked into immobility. The doll’s moist surface glistened in the moonlight. “Emma…”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emma’s eyes widened in glee. “Oh, joy! Zelda!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Do you want to be my friend, Emma?” The voice was soft, unwavering. It echoed strangely around the lake, as though it existed only in one’s own mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yes!” Emma stepped forward, one foot in the lake, damp and cold, one foot on the bank of the lank, warm and dry and hesitant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Come, Emma,” said the soothing voice of her only acquaintance in the whole wide world. Emma lifted her other foot and raised an arm, hopeful, happy..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lake churned, a slow and steady wave that started in the middle. The wind was suddenly strong… too strong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yes, Emma,” said the voice. &lt;i&gt;Voices…&lt;/i&gt; Emma glanced up at the sky, her face locked in a wide grin. There was a thunder cloud rolling in. Even as her hair was whipped around by the howling wind, both her feet touched the lake, and she was completely within its boundaries. “We’ll finally be able to play!” the voices rose in a sharp crescendo, and there was a loud thunderclap, the loudest you could imagine, and a burst of lightning lit the entire sky up, and for a brief moment one could have seen the entire countryside, and its lush meadows, and the strange lake down yonder, and the silhouette of a little girl reaching out for something dark up ahead, and then the moment passed, swift, like a photo flash, and then lake was silent again.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Don't shoot the messenger]]></title><description><![CDATA[People who claim that Tokyo is a cool place haven’t actually had to run from a dozen rabid dogs in the middle of the night.

My job brings with it the privilege of the rabid dog chase every other month or so. Become a spy, they said. You’ll get cool guns and stuff, they said. Well, I’m getting something else too: pissed off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I step off the monorail and make my way up the city junction, I take a moment to appreciate the billboard-dense sky of the most retro metropolis to exist after the Great Space War. Loud red and blue neon lights flash everywhere, a digital rain that bounces from one skyline to another. It’s the year 2071, and everything has changed. AI, the existence of aliens, the whole nine yards. No one has bent space and time yet, so that’s cool. At least my trenchcoat is still in vogue. I stride along the herd of other dark entities, hidden in the shadows cast by kilometers of bright lighting strips that lit the city up. Downtown is packed and sweaty, and some deep techno music is playing somewhere out there, nicely muffled by the silent humming of the city’s dank underbelly. I feel weary, and my legs feel like they’re made of lead. I stumble, and right before my vision blurs, a dingy convenience store looms up in my vision. Tightening my trenchcoat and making sure my gun’s still in the holster, I trudge through the last couple of meters and push my way into the public restroom. “Ah, &lt;i&gt;fuck&lt;/i&gt;…” I say, to the extremely crusty-looking man in the mirror.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My handler has been missing for a couple days. I haven’t showered for roughly the same amount of time. &lt;i&gt;Dave…&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the cold, suspiciously slimy water washes over my face, I run over the events that had take place in the past 48 hours. Dave had gone missing very randomly, and although he was a prick, he wasn’t irresponsible. The middle-aged man had been my mentor for several months after I was approved for field service. It began to rain outside, more or less at the same time that my phone rang. I jump, startled by the sudden vibration next to my hip. &lt;i&gt;Why am I so jittery?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Letterman?” a raspy voice hisses at me through the phone. “Charlie, is that you?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Holy shit, Dave?” I stumble toward the exit. “Where are yo-”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Listen, Charlie, you stupid idiot. Don’t believe them, yeah? It’s not what you think. Get to safety asap. Don’t worry about m-” &lt;i&gt;Thwack!&lt;/i&gt; A very wet-sounding thud echoes in the background, and he hangs up. My real name is not Charlie Letterman. I may be a loser, but I’m not the CEO of losers. I’ve always wondered what Dave’s real name was; he always seemed to me like a real Dave. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I can properly react to this strange call, however, the door of the restroom is thrown open and a woman dressed in full black camouflage enters, knee first. I am a very averagely built man. My face was declared the fifth most-forgettable face in college. But for someone with a beergut and a balding head, I am an agile dude. As the woman’s knee swooshes toward my abdomen, I shove an elbow into her thigh, even as my phone makes its way into one of the folds of my trench coat. Nifty piece of apparel, let me tell ya. The woman is thrown back. I reach for the darkness outside the door. I have to find Dave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The woman reaches into her blouse and produces a blade. It clinks open in the dim hallway. &lt;i&gt;How is that even comfortable? Doesn’t it poke into your flesh?&lt;/i&gt; I think, and kick at her left knee with all my might. There’s a satisfying &lt;i&gt;crunch&lt;/i&gt;, and the knee bends the other way. The woman shrieks, and I shut her up with an elbow to her temple. It’s not personal. It never is. That’s the beauty of spycraft. We’re like thieves, but with honor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I run through the night, squelching through the station’s parking lot, over a few backyards, into a gaming arcade that’s supposed to be “in ruins” but it really is a front for a safehouse. Several years as a logistics expert, half a year into field service but I’m never not surprised by the ingenuity of spies. The arcade is dusty and smells like scorched ciruit boards. More LED lighting everywhere. I make my way through the tarp-covered pinball machines and TRON consoles and space shooter VR rigs, all the way into the back office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My phone screen lights up for a moment, and the LED blinks orange a couple times. I have a new unread email. Who the fuck’s sending me emails right now?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;n8: don’t enter&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s all the body of the email says. Strange. I put the phone away; there will be time to look at that stuff later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a moldy-looking keypad next to the door. I put my eye in front of it. A silent whirring signals that the futuristic mechanism of the retina scanner is doing its job. &lt;i&gt;Click.&lt;/i&gt; The door opens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me and Dave? We’re part of a private outfit. We don’t work for the government, not exactly, no. We work for parts of the government - or a faction of a huge corporation - that wants to do dirty work but can’t be bothered to wash hands. So we do the work for them. All the governments in the world have such outfits waiting in the wings. Plus, since we’re on contract, the plausible deniability clause is the government’s best friend. Someone invented a pocket raygun? We go in and clean it up so the government can “repurpose the inventions for the protection and benefit of its people”. Think black-ops, but older-looking people who can blend in. That was Dave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dave, who’s currently sitting in the couch at the arcade’s back office, his face mangled and his arms broken. “Dave?” I rush to see if he was okay, but-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Ah ah ah,” a voice whispers from the darkness. &lt;i&gt;Shit.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s Jet Yamada, the guy I was supposed to “rehabilitate”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;TWO HOURS AGO&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yamada is a scientist of some or the other sort. Supposedly he invented a &lt;i&gt;hopper&lt;/i&gt;, a device that allows you to communicate with people in parallel dimensions. Sure, sure, it’s all supposed to be fancy and what not, but as a professional, I’m least concerned with the device itself. My job is to secure all personnel and ‘equipment’ that may be instrumental to the growth of our private espionage outfit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m at his office, where I was supposed to meet Dave, once again, who has been AWOL for god knows how long. Yamada has ties to the neo-Yakuza, who have ties to some other shady people, who regularly kill people for a living. The neo-Yakuza stopped getting involved in local skirmishes a long time ago. His office is a very posh space, designed by a blind woman he recruited from the mountains. Bunch of nice artwork too, very hip. Anyway, &lt;i&gt;Dave and I&lt;/i&gt; were supposed to pick the device up from Yamada, and let him know that his invention would be used for bigger solutions for bigger problems in the bigger picture. I was allowed a limit of sixteen million credits to help convince him. Dave’s like the best negotiator I’ve ever seen. He could convince inventors to join a cult or something, from what I’d seen of him in the field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Dave isn’t here right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;NOW&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t exactly remember what went wrong at Yamada’s office, but I remember that he was very, very angry. And he’s very, very angry even now, two hours after I had managed to give him the slip. It’s safe to assume that the woman who had attacked me at the convenience store worked for Yamada. Rich guy, very cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hopper looks like a little flip phone, but the hinge is cosmetic. So it’s a flip phone that doesn’t flip. It has a nice little sturdy-looking antenna thingy on one end. Yamada was holding the hopper when he walked into the light, but it’s in his pocket, safe from me and Dave now. &lt;i&gt;Dave…&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yamada motions with his gun. I take a seat opposite Dave, in the recliner across the coffee table from the couch. Dave is slumped, his face is bloodied and there are pieces of flesh and muscle sticking out from his cheeks and jaw. Someone has done quite a number on him. Maybe it was the woman?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Charlie,” says Yamada, his voice smooth. Like I said, Japanese hip. Very cool. “Let’s see the gun.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yamada,” I say back. I take the gun carefully out from my trenchcoat and place it on the table. Dave isn’t moving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You really thought you could take my life’s work from me, for what, sixteen mil?” Yamada laughs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Haha,” I say politely, and jump at him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing about good guys, villains, and anti-heroes is that there’s a lot of talking involved in a situation like this. Say, for example, that Yamada would have gone on rambling about his invention, and how it implied a paradigm shift in the several interpretations of the string theory, and that the time-slice hypothesis may need to be revamped from the ground up. But it doesn’t matter to me, because I am just a guy trying to do my job. I do not care for this madman’s plans. While Yamada is half-turned with his own gun pointed slightly away from me, I grab my gun and point it at Yamada, swiftly reaching for the device with my other hand. For all his hipness, Yamada is pretty fast, he turns and squeezes the trigger. It’s a gun similar to mine: it doesn’t shoot bullets, it shoots compressed packets of energy. The shot hits me square in the lower chest, and I barely manage to shoot my own shot. &lt;i&gt;Ping!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yamada takes the hit in his face, point blank. Let me take a short moment to explain how these energy packets work. From the point of impact, they explode outward, into the victim’s body. Yamada’s face implodes and his gun drops out of his hand. My chest isn’t faring much better; there’s a gaping hole in my core.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel my consciousness slipping. Surely there has to be a way to avoid this outcome, you know? With the blood leaving my body fast, I have to struggle to grab the hopper from Yamada’s pocket. My fingers are pale and feel like dandelions, light and fluffy and almost gone…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For an interdimensional device, the hopper is a strange appliance. I type out an email message to the only person I trust, with my real name in the message so I know it’s me. I spend the last ounce of energy I have left to hit &lt;i&gt;send&lt;/i&gt;, and then I let go, taking solace in the fact that I’ll definitely get the message in time. As my eyes close for what seems like the last time, I let my mind take control from the lizard brain. The message should reach me before I enter the office, and I won’t enter, and I’ll manage to save Dave, and everything will be fine…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— &lt;/p&gt;

The plot is that two Americans meet in an entirely unfamiliar setting in Tokyo, Japan, and find meaning in something strangely peaceful. Both are at different stages of their lives, dealing with their own personal crises, but somehow manage to find solace in each other’s presence. Spoilers ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bill Murray plays Bob Harris, a typical Bill Murray character: deadpan, sardonic, and an actor tired of people in general who has been sent to Japan to film whiskey commercials and appear on talk shows. Scarlett Johannson plays Charlotte, a philosophy graduate whose search for meaning has led her with her husband (a photographer) to Japan, where she’s still lost. Very typical characters, nothing extraordinary, but the film’s strength lies in its ability to convey meaning very slowly. The main characters don’t even see each other a good ten minutes into the film, but it’s ultimately worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bob struggles with the culture shock, and so does Charlotte. They are both also heavily jetlagged, as is evident from the numerous times they ask each other if they’ve had a good sleep. Bob is twenty-five years into his marriage, and is on an unsolicited break from his wife. Charlotte is having misgivings about being married to a celebrity photographer who doesn’t really understand her. And on a continent far, far from home, they run into each other in the midst of chaos, a pair of guests who’ve never experienced Japan before, or new feelings towards anyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Charlotte sends Bob a drink at the hotel, Bob realizes something that he’s wanted to realize for a while; he can be goofy around this person and not get treated a certain type of way. As my friend pointed out, Charlotte does not care one bit that Bob is a very famous actor with his face plastered all over billboards even in Tokyo, which is a refreshing change for Bob. No, she’s looking for something that Bob is looking for too - a companion in a strange land. We see Bob and Charlotte bond over karaoke among strangers mispronouncing mundane things, and developing into… what exactly? That is unclear, but we see both characters warming up to each other. Bob talks to Charlotte about the drastic changes that come with becoming a parent. Charlotte opens up about her identity crisis, her uncertain future with her husband. She finds herself being completely fine with having an older man by her side, effectively chilling out. Bob is also struggling with having to accept that both of his own kids are getting used to him not being around, which he speaks about briefly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most fascinating parts of the movie is how it uses crowds. If you’ve watched any modern drama, you’ll notice how crisp and focused scenes are with the protagonists. Lost in Translation does the exact opposite. Some of the most significant scenes in the film contain a bunch of Japanese people walking on streets and partying and just basically being in the frame. The movie uses a lot of skylines and billboards, and it uses them rather well. By the end of the film, we see that Bob and Charlotte have found very warm solace in each other. But the film must end at some point, as all good things do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is an important scene at the very end of the film where Bob whispers something to Charlotte before kissing her goodbye forever. To me, this is the most poignant shot of the film, and is aptly left open to interpretation, again, perhaps, a subtle allusion to the title. A great film, a bit sad, but overall fantastic.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Layover Woes]]></title><description><![CDATA[Heathrow International Airport, London, has been a friendly stranger to me for the 3-odd hours I have spent with it.

As the title suggests, I have an 8-hour layover here. And then an 8-hour flight. And then an 8-hour sleep regime in my own bed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the best things about international airports is that you can observe and document as much as you want for character inspiration. Not to say that the British gentleman staring back at me might not have been James Bond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, I return home after almost a year. This, while not much of a deal to the casual observer, is kind of a big deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a lot to be said about studying/working in the United States. Most of it is subjective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But anyway this will be a short post because the layover is kind of exhausting and it brings with it a very crisp flavor of ennui.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peace.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[In The Shadow of A Curse]]></title><description><![CDATA[I recall the fateful moment when my editor called me on a Sunday night, her voice equal parts sad and excited; there was a story to be…]]></description><link>https://parth.ninja/blog//shadow-curse/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://parth.ninja/blog//shadow-curse/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 02 Jun 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;I recall the fateful moment when my editor called me on a Sunday night, her voice equal parts sad and excited; there was a story to be written about the notorious magician from the Midwest. When, at 45, Hermann “Hex” Zilchberg was crowned the youngest Top Wizard of the Globe in 2018, his audience assumed that he would go for the Top Wizard of the Galaxy trophy next. Nobody expected the next trick up his sleeve to be an untimely demise and a tarnished legacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hermann — or “Hex”, as he vehemently insisted on being called — stood on his fabled stage at the Manhattan Hall for Spells almost exactly seventeen years ago, where he did his first trick in front of a drunk audience. It was a Pinky Break: he got a buzzed young lady to choose a card, put it back, and made it appear that her card was lost in the middle, but the card’s location was actually being marked by Hex’s pinky. The trick, forgive the pun, did the trick, and the young woman’s laughs were heard resoundingly throughout the half-filled hall. Hex and the young lady, Zoe Mulaney, got married two years later. When I got the opportunity to speak with Mrs. Mulaney-Zilchberg (“Please, call me Zoe. Only the lawyer calls me that.”) at her husband’s funeral, she appeared to me as a woman who had seen too much to fear seeing some more. “He may not have been the best husband in the world, but he was the greatest magician I’ve ever known,” she told me. Her black gown was unadorned but for a simple red heart-shaped brooch, only slightly bigger than her thumbnail. “His anniversary gift to me,” she smiled, playing with it gently. “He didn’t forget this year.” The funeral service was lovingly dubbed The Disappearing Act by Hex’s posse of assistants and stagehands. There were bigwigs from all over the industry there. The man and his magic had been loved. It was a beautiful service — perhaps too beautiful to be appropriate for such a troubled individual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hex Zilchberg was born Hermann Zilchberg the Second to a family of locksmiths in Switzerland. A child with three siblings, he grew up poor and resilient in the streets of rural St. Porten. The Zilchbergs cared less for material entertainment than they did about their children, succumbing to a car crash when Hex was 14. They were both drunk. Hex, his brother Hans, and his sisters, Ilaya and Mary, fled Switzerland under the guise of foster children, and over the course of a decade, had moved to the States. Hermann Zilchberg roamed the states and spent his youth in the Midwest under colorful names. Hans went on to become an architect, Ilaya became an artist, and Mary was found at rehab every six months. She still is at rehab, hence her absence from the service. Hans and Ilaya were very open with me; they disapproved with a passion of what their brother had chosen to do with his life. Hans, in particular, still bore signs of indignation as he spoke of his late brother. “The smartest man I knew, that guy. He could’ve sent men to Mars. He could’ve found the cure to cancer. Wait, he almost did!” laughs Hans sadly. He refuses to address his brother by his stage name. “I knew Hermann as much as he allowed anyone to. He was a man consumed by the notion of bringing joy and excitement to strangers.” “And the notion of bringing pain to the people who loved him,” whispers Ilaya. As a reclusive artist, Ilaya makes few public appearances. She spoke to me in hushed tones about Hex and his struggle with accepting his family.“Herm- Hex was a good man. He knew what he was doing. He always knew what to do, but not what not to do. He wanted to do everything.” Hans sighed, glancing at the ornate casket of the late magician. “His greatest trick was fooling people into thinking he was doing okay.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zoe and Hex had been together for seventeen years, and they had been far from easy. I managed to meet Zoe again, two weeks after the funeral service. At forty-three, she has more grace than I do at twenty-six. She bought me a fulsome dinner while we spoke of the man she had loved for years. She wore a turquoise dress. The brooch was still there. “It’s an Olympic task to love a man whose favorite mistress is sleight-of-hand.” Hex was known to disappear from the face of the earth for months at a time. “He always wanted to find the perfect trick, you know?” Zoe twiddled her thumbs, still playing with the brooch. “Always the perfect trick. Always the perfect execution.” Only two years ago, in 2017, Hex made a visit to Chernobyl. He was experimenting with subjects who had been affected…badly. It got him the greatest award a magician could receive on earth. “Hex was a fool. I loved him with all my heart but he was a fool. His audience was everything to him.” Zoe reminisces on how she used to sneak into the audience every week just to catch a glimpse of him laughing heartily. “Many people don’t know this,” Zoe says, winking conspiratorially, “But he started out as a street con-man.” When I let my shock be evident, she nodded and chuckled, almost proudly. “A wild one, that young Hex. He swindled people out of their valuables for a good seven months before he met me. Then he swindled me out of my heart.” We parted ways an hour later, and Zoe left me a note that said: Be truthful about whatever you write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hermann Zilchberg had struggled with antisocial personality disorder and depression from a very early age. His years as a street-performer had marked him as one of the most eccentric magicians ever. Hex was known to engage in bodily self-harm regularly. “I’m practicing a trick,” was his standard explanation. This included incidents like cutting off chunks of his tongue with live audiences, setting his hair on fire only to turn it to water a minute later. People from his hometown began to call him “The Cursed One.” This only drove Hex to more garish displays of “magic”. There is only one recorded interview in existence of Hex. It shows him in full magician garb (a dark maroon cloak and a top hat he made himself), sitting cross-legged in the spotlight, not a care in the world except the next abracadabra. The camera zooms in on his gaunt face. “Magic,” he intones in a calm baritone, “is as close I can get to the language of the Gods.” He uncrosses his legs and stares into the camera; Hex had a charisma around him uncharacteristic even of the most seasoned stage artists. “It isn’t math,” he scoffs. “Numbers don’t make people drop their jaws and clutch at their hearts. It’s always magic. It always was, always has been, always will be.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chernobyl was Hex’s opus dei. The Futility of Man, it was called. He found out that the radiation poisoning was still high, but was receding in quantity. “And for my next trick, I will beat death at His own game,” said the headline when he returned to Manhattan. Hex had obtained gallons of toxic water from Chernobyl. The same water was being supplied to homes around Chernobyl. In late 2018, he froze himself in it, fully naked. His six-foot lean frame was fed live to screens for a whole day before he managed to produce a singe card — the ace of hearts — and set himself free. The radiation did a number on him in the immediate next month, and he was hospitalized. He never recovered from it. He died in his sleep three days later, having suffered organ failure to an incredible extent. Zoe says, and I quote, “He was smiling, the bastard.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For whatever may have driven him to such extremes, Hermann “Hex” Zilchberg had been blessed with a curse. He could make everyone happy except the ones who cared. This included himself. Maybe Hans was wrong. Maybe Hex’s greatest trick was really finding himself in his last breath. It’s like they always say: life is tricky.&lt;/p&gt;
